###  post processing of 3D printed parts
Parts produced with 3d printing require some treatment after the printing process in order to enhance the properties of the object. The main post-processing treatments for 3D printed parts include support removal, UV curing and heat treatment.

#### 1. Support Removal
Support structures are the structures that hold up the overhang features in the parts. These structures can be printed utilizing a similar material as the one with which the actual model is printed. However, when the machine considers printing with numerous materials, other printing material can be used. At whatever point support structure is needed, there will be some post-handling included. When utilizing dissolvable material, there is a lower hazard of harming the model. The support structure can be broken up in water or with a chemical solution.

#### 2.	UV Curing
Heating the models after they have been printed upgrades the mechanical properties of the material. Carbon has been added during curing using UV light to their printing interaction. Curing machines heat the model to bring it to its ideal mechanical properties after being printed. Curing differs from the other post processing options as it enhances also the physical quality of the model with properties.

#### 3. Heat Treatment
3D printed metal segments are quite often heat treated. Heat treatment removes the internal stresses developed in part during printing and changes the part's microstructure. Normally in modern use, the microstructure's change targets explicit properties like hardness, strength, sturdiness, and wear opposition.
